# CIFAR10_Image-Classification

About the Dataset:
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32X32 images which are divided into 10 categories (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, etc.) and each category has 6000 images. The images are split in train and test.Train- 50,000 observationsTest- 10,000 observations.

Library used for processing CIFAR-10 dataset: 
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, which runs on Python and uses TensorFlow in the background. It allows for fast prototyping.
